# Horiseon

## Description

Horiseon is a website that contains information about search engine optimization (SEO), online reputation management and social media marketing.

In this repository, I refactored the source code in order the website meets accessibility criteria:

- Replaced certain HTML elements with semantic elements
- Made sure that headings fall in sequential order
- Changed the `title` element's inner text with more descriptive one
- Added `alt` attributes with descriptive texts to each image elements
- Added meta tags
- Adjusted the broken link
- Consolidated the CSS selectors and properties
- Commented CSS file appropriately
- Adjusted background color of the `aside` so it has enough color contrast ratio
